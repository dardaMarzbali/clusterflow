# Cluster Flow Documentation

You've found the Cluster Flow docs, nice! These are written in markdown and
are now bundled with the source code for easier access.

Whilst the raw markdown looks lovely (especially on GitHub), you may prefer
to view these docs on the [Cluster Flow website](http://clusterflow.io),
where they are rendered into an aesthetically pleasing website for
your delectation: [clusterflow.io](http://clusterflow.io)

If you'd rather stick with the raw docs, here's what's available:

- [Docs Homepage](index.md)
- [Installation Instructions](installation.md)
- [General Usage](usage.md)
- [Command Line Reference](cl_reference.md)
- [Writing Pipelines & Modules](writing_pipelines_modules.md)
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)

If you're curious how the website works, see [_site](_site) for the source code.
