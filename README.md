---

Cluster Flow is a pipelining tool to automate and standardise
bioinformatics analyses on high-performance cluster environments.
It is designed to be easy to use, quick to set up and flexible to configure.

Cluster Flow is written in Perl and works by launching jobs to a cluster
(can also be run locally). Each job is a stand-alone Perl executable wrapper
around a bioinformatics tool of interest.

Modules collect extensive logging information and Cluster Flow e-mails
the user with a summary of the pipeline commands and exit codes upon completion.

## Installation
You can find stable versions to download on the
[releases page](https://github.com/ewels/clusterflow/releases).

You can get the development version of the code by cloning this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ewels/clusterflow.git
```

Once downloaded and extracted, create a `clusterflow.config` file in the
script directory, based on `clusterflow.config.example`.

Next, you need to add the main `cf` executable to your `PATH`. This can be done
as an environment module, with a symlink to `bin` or by adding to your `~/.bashrc`
file.

Finally, run the setup wizard (`cf --setup`) and genomes wizard (`cf --add_genome`) and
you're ready to go! See the [installation docs](docs/installation.md) for more
information.

## Usage
Pipelines are launched by naming a pipeline or module and the input files. A simple
example could look like this:
```bash
cf sra_trim *.fastq.gz
```

Most pipelines need reference genomes, and Cluster Flow has built in reference
genome management. Parameters can be passed to modify tool behaviour.

For example, to run the `fastq_bowtie` pipeline (FastQC, TrimGalore! and Bowtie)
with Human data, trimming the first 6bp of read 1, the command would be:

```bash
cf --genome GRCh37 --params "clip_r1=6" fastq_bowtie *.fastq.gz
```

Additional common Cluster Flow commands are as follows:
```bash
cf --genomes     # List available reference genomes
cf --pipelines   # List available pipelines
cf --modules     # List available modules
cf --qstat       # List running pipelines
cf --qdel [id]   # Cancel jobs for a running pipeline
```
